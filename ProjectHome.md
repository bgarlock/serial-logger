I wrote this script to capture log data from our T1 routers for debugging purposes. There are some comments in the file for configuration. I run this in the background on Redhat 6.2 machines, at our remote locations. Eventually I plan to add more features, like logging to syslog, so I can get timestamps, which Multitech doesn't currently support on their routers. No warranty, and use at your own risk! (Seems to work fine in my environment, though) You could also port this to a win32 environment too.
